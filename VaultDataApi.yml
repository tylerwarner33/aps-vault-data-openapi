        This endpoint should be invoked only for DWF/DWFx file. Retrieves the bubble.json file, which serves as the root file for the Autodesk Large Model Viewer (LMV) format. It provides essential metadata and structure information required to render 2D/3D models or other complex visualizations in the LMV viewer.

        Note: When requesting this endpoint for a file version first time, the server would trigger a low priority job in background to generate the bubble.json and other LMV related visualization files, which will be cached for subsequent use. Subsequent calls to this endpoint will retrieve the bubble.json from the cache directly.
        In order to get the associated DWF/DWFx file (if available) for a CAD file, "visualization-attachments" endpoint should be used.

        Indicates the current status of the indexing engine. This status helps users understand whether the indexing operation is complete or still in progress. This is particularly important for customers with large datasets, as indexing can take a considerable amount of time to complete.
        The statuses include:

        - ``IndexingComplete`` - All properties and content have been indexed.
        - ``IndexingProperties`` - File properties are currently being indexed.
        - ``IndexingContent`` - File content is currently being indexed.
        - ``NA`` - Not applicable as data not retrieved from index.

        Note: When the status is either 'IndexingProperties' or 'IndexingContent', the search results are incomplete because the indexes are still being created. Complete search results will be available once fully indexed.
